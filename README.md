We reproduced the Quantum Tensor Networks (QTN) source code based on the paper "Quantum-Inspired Framework for Computational Fluid Dynamics" and applied it to the Burgers' Equation 1D Shock Tube. We then compared the obtained solutions with those from the classical RK45 method and the quantum-based Quantum Neural Network method (QPINN). The results show that all three methods produce fairly similar solutions.
